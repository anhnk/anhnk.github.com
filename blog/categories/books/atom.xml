    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first time I started writing daily was when my 4th year teacher suggested me to write a diary. I wrote an A4 page on the 1st day. I used a lot of space to describe the weather, the sky and the people on the street before I talked about what had happened during the day. Gradually, my diary page kept shrinking and shrinking until it became only a sixth of an A4. After all, the weather, the sky and the people were still the same. No need for repetition.</p>

<p>You might have guessed that I stopped writing my diary in no time. You are right. I did. But I loved keeping a diary. The idea of storing my own thoughts in <em>a box</em> and someday taking them out to look at really excites me. I was discouraged to write often because I didn't know how to do it well enough to make the words <em>sound</em> good later. I have always sucked at literature, history and writing in school.</p>

<p>But at least I tried. It is impossible to remember how many times I started writing a diary/journal again. I feel much easier to write now. The words aren't necessarily poured out, but I don't have to force myself to sit down and open a text editor. Everyday I commute from home to work and vice versa, I sit on the train for total of 40 minutes. 40 minutes/day times 5 days/week, times 52 weeks/year, equals more than 173 hours per year. That amount of time will be well spent on writing, if not reading.</p>

<h1>How to Write</h1>

<p>On 7 September 1982, David Ogilvy - iconic businessman and original "Mad Man" - sent to all agency employees the following internal memo, titled "How to Write":</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy &amp; Mather. People who think well write well.</p></p><p><p>Woolly-minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches.</p></p><p><p>Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10 hints:</p></p><p><ol><br/><li><p>Read the Roman-Raphaelson <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Works-Communicate-Effectively-Business/dp/0060956437/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359337954&sr=8-1&keywords=writing+that+works" target="_blank">book on writing</a>. Read it three times.</p></li><br/><li><p>Write the way you talk. Naturally.</p></li><br/><li><p>Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.</p></li><br/><li><p>Never use jargon words like 'reconceptualize', 'demassification', 'attitudinally', 'judgmentally'. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass.</p></li><br/><li><p>Never write more than two pages on any subject.</p></li><br/><li><p>Check your quotations.</p></li><br/><li><p>Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning - and then edit it.</p></li><br/><li><p>If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.</p></li><br/><li><p>Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.</p></li><br/><li><p>If you want ACTION, don't write. Go and tell the guy what you want.</p></li><br/></ol></p><p><br/><p>David</p></p><p><p></p></blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Works-Communicate-Effectively-Business/dp/0060956437/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359337954&sr=8-1&keywords=writing+that+works" target="_blank"><em>Writing that Works</em></a>, recommended by Ogilvy, is a book on writing in business context. Another one that teaches general writing is <em>The Elements of Style</em>, also known as <em>The Strunk and White</em>.</p>

<h1>The 10,000 Hour Rule</h1>

<p>It takes approximately 10,000 hours for someone to be good at something. Bill Gates spent about 10,000 hours writing codes before he published his first commercial software. The Beatles also spent that long practicing and playing in a band in bars and nightclubs before they became popular. Bruce Lee once said he feared not the man who had practiced 10,000 kicks once, but the man who had practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p>

<p>Conservatively speaking, if 3 hours is spent on writing everyday, it will take more than 9 years to achieve 10,000 hours. The best time to start writing is NOW.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <em>The How of Happiness</em>, with thorough research, Sonja Lyubomirsky provides a scientific approach to pursue happiness. This book lifted me up when I was down. Though there are things that lie outside of my Circle of Influence and it is true that there is such a gene called “happiness gene”, I am delighted to know that I can make shots to make me happier, even if I don’t inherit that gene from my parents.</p>

<h1>My Notes</h1>

<blockquote><p>It’s never too late to be what you might have been. - George Elliot</p></blockquote>

<h2>1. The 40% Solution</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://img.skitch.com/20121009-nkendgrm99pkd786xuri5itj1f.jpg" title="What determines happiness" ></p>

<p>Becoming lastingly happier demands making some permanent changes that require effort and commitment everyday of your life. Pursuing happiness takes work, but consider that this “happiness work” will be the most rewarding work you’ll ever do.</p>

<p>Subjective Happiness Scale, Depression Scale, Personal-Activity Fit Diagnostic (refer the book)</p>

<p><strong>Myth 1: Happiness must be found.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Myth 2: Happiness lies in changing our circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Myth 3: You either have it or you don’t.</strong></p>

<h3>The limits of life circumstances:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>material wealth: Frank Lloyd Wright observed: “Many wealthy people are little more than the janitors of their possessions.” Not only does materialism not bring happiness, but it’s been shown to be a strong predictor of unhappiness.</p></li>
<li><p>beauty.</p></li>
<li><p>The only exception that I would argue is the effects of having children. As a mother of two I can attest that the first time you cuddle with your child, it feels wonderful. The thousandth time, it feels – oh, maybe 95 percent as wonderful.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you’re unhappy with your job, your friends, your marriage, your salary, or your looks, the first step you should take toward reaching greater lasting happiness is to put those things aside in your mind for now. Hard as it is, try not to reflect on them. Keep reminding yourself that these things are really not what is preventing you from getting happier.</p>

<p>If we observe genuinely happy people, we shall find that they do not just sit around being contented. They make things happen. They pursue new understandings, seek new achievements, and control their thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Happiness consists in activity. It is a running stream, not a stagnant pool.</p>

<h3>Five hows behind sustainable happiness:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Positive Emotion: Happiness consists more in small conveniences or pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of good fortune that happen but seldom. – Benjamin Franklin</p></li>
<li><p>Optimal Timing &amp; Variety: How to accomplish this? Through experimentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Support.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation, Effort, and Commitment</p></li>
<li><p>Habit</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>First, I will try the Happiness Activity 3: Avoiding Overthinking and Social Comparison</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Overthinking is thinking too much, needlessly, passively, endlessly, and excessivly pondering the meanings, causes, and consequences of your character, your feelings, and your problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of us believe that when we feel down, we should try to focus inwardly and evaluate our feelings and our situation in order to attain self-insight and find solutions that might ultimately resolve our problems and relieve unhappiness. In fact, studies show that overthinking ushers in a host of adverse consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>You must imitate the behaviour of the happy person and work to break free of overthinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Comparison: The happiness people take pleasure in other people’s success and show concern in the face of others’ failure.  Unhappy people are deflated rather than delighted about his peers’ accomplishments and triumphs and are relieved rather than sympathetic in the face of his peers’ failures and undoings.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>2. How to Shake of Ruminations and Social Comparisons</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut loose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stop thinking about it. Distract, distract, distract. The distracting activity is what can make you feel happy, curious, peaceful, amused, proud.</p></li>
<li><p>Shout to yourself “STOP!”, “NO!”. Visualize a STOP sign.</p></li>
<li><p>Set aside time for ruminations (deep reflections) later.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to a sympathetic and trusted person.</p></li>
<li><p>Write out your ruminations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Act to solve problems: find possible solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dodge overthinking triggers: avoid future overthinking traps (places, times, and people)</p></li>
<li><p>Take in a big picture: Ask yourself “Does it matter in a year?”. If no, stop overthinking. If yes, learn the lessons. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</p></li>
</ul>
