    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just ironed some shirts and trousers that are enough for me to wear for the next week. I also laid a coat of Kiwi polish on my black shoes and would brush them tomorrow morning. It’s a tip I learned before. Lay the polish coat on the leather shoes and let it lie there for one night before you brush it away. Try it. Trust me, you will be happy.</p>

<p>I am fond of saying a true gentleman doesn’t feel properly dressed unless his shoes are freshly shined every morning. And I love the ritual so much that I can’t help but do it very often. That ritual makes me so happy.</p>

<p>So far, I learned quite a lot about what makes me happy and what doesn’t. Polishing my shoes makes me happy. Ironing my clothes myself, not having someone else do it except my girlfriend, makes me happy. Playing billiards with my close friends makes me happy. Winning certainly makes me happier than losing, but losing still does if it is worth it.</p>

<p>There is one thing which always makes me miserable and usually screw up other things. Something happens to me the way it is not expected, I just spend plenty of time contemplating on turning it to the way it should be. And when things get worse, I feel like a loser. I can’t think of anything else. My girlfriend and I have big fights because of this.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Anh Do, and I am an over-thinker.</p>

<p>Over-thinking is thinking too much, needlessly, passively, endlessly and excessively pondering the meaning, causes, and consequences of your character, your feelings and your problems. Many people (including me) believe that when they feel down, they should focus inwardly and evaluate their feelings and situation in order to find self-insight and solutions that might ultimately resolve the issues and relieve unhappiness. Many studies, however, show that over-thinking ushers in a host of adverse consequences.</p>

<h2>How I will stop it:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Distract, distract, distract. I’ll listen to my favorite Brian Culbertson’s album, go swimming or do whatever I find interesting.</li>
<li>Set aside time to think about it later. If it matters in a year, find a solution. If not, just forget it. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</li>
<li>Talk to a sympathetic and trusted person.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have started doing this for more than 3 weeks and my level of happiness improved. Nevertheless, sometimes I still fell in my own trap. Everything needs practice. For something related to one’s nature, it takes time and patience. I need help from you also. If you, my friends, find me over-thinking, please tap me on the shoulder or if you don’t mind, shout at me and hit me in the head. I will be thankful. You have my word.</p>
