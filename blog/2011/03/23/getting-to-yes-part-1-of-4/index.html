<div class="entry-content"><p>This semester at RMIT, I take a very interesting course named “Negotiating Transnational Agreement”. Many things in our lives require good negotiation skills. I bet a lot of insights would be gained from this course.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>In the 2nd week, I had my first team exercise. We were members of a team of agents representing the Lyric Opera (LO), a local opera house. We would meet a team of agents for a singer named Sally Soprano (SS) who wanted to sing in LO’s next opera. Our team is supposed to negotiate with the other team on the package that we would pay SS in order to hire her for the primary role of the opera. A lot of information surrounding the case is provided. Choosing which info to use is the challenging part of the exercise, since a rule of thumb during a negotiation is “only give up information about us and our position that will enhance our bargaining power”.</p>

<p>Therefore, we as one team prepared for the negotiation by identifying clearly what our Best Alternative To the Negotiated Agreement (BATNA), Reservation Price/Position, and Target/Aspiration Price. If we could not reach the agreement with SS’s agents, our BATNA would be get the secondary role singer to sing as primary role and we just have to pay maximum $28,000. Nevertheless, that would be our last choice and we would do our best to get Sally.</p>

<p>The other team, our counterparts, are really tough negotiators. Based on Thomas-Kilmann Questionnaire, I thought that they approached us with competing/forcing style (sharks). There are five negotiating styles but there is no negotiating style that is perfectly fit for every situation. I wish I knew which style is the best to deal with sharks. At that time, out team just used the method of principled negotiation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300873936&amp;sr=8-1-spell">Getting to Yes</a> by insisting on fairness. We discussed about why their offer was reasonable. With their first offer $50,000, I knew that I could make it in under $45,000. However, I didn’t want to accept the offer so fast. Therefore, we tried to press the price down. In the middle of the negotiation, I felt we were falling in positional bargaining. I got out of that situation by investigating more of our interests and theirs. Our group wanted to ensure good ticket sales and opera’s reputation, and their interest was good salary and reputation as well. Therefore, I made them involve more on the opera’s revenue by dividing the salary into 2 parts: fixed salary and bonus (if sales target is met).</p>

<p>What we could have done better is to be the one who offer the price first because that would set the price range. Besides, we should have requested for a confidentiality agreement that the other party keep the salary a secret since this was an urgent case so that in future salary negotiating, we wouldn’t overpay the singer.</p>

<p>One of the skills that I always use in real-life cases whether it is to resolve a dispute and engage in a negotiation with someone is listening skill. It works perfectly because by listening carefully, I let them know that I am really interested in collaborating with them to find the solution for the problem. Our same opponent is the problem itself and our mission is to work together to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Personally, I can’t think of any complaints about this course. It has been more than what I had expected before the semester began. The idea of principled negotiation is so innovative, and I believe that it can be applied in every situation.</p>

<p>Bruce Lee once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess what I should do now is to start using this method in every negotiation I have.</p>
