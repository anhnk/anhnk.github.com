  <div class="entry-content"><p>The easiest case ever! Here is the background of the case. My client, Ms. Taylor brought her custom-tailored clothes to Elegance Cleaners for dry cleaning. Unfortunately, their machine destroyed the clothes. Ms. Taylor asked for a compensation of $330 and the counter offer was $80.</p>

<p>My counterpart and I represented as Ms. Taylor and Elegance Cleaners’ lawyers respectively. Two of us knew about each other before. In fact, we had good impression with each other before. I bet this fact helped a lot in the negotiation. Without asking so many questions, we totally understood our interests and reached a successful agreement shortly. Why was it a successful agreement? According to GTY, a negotiation is successful when:</p>

<pre><code>1) It leads to wise agreement.
2) It is efficient. In other words, it doesn’t take so much time or effort.
3) It enhances a strong relationship.
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, I did not focus too much on the money. There were way more things I could get besides the compensation money. I’d rather talk about our relationship, and how Ms. Taylor loved to go to Elegance Cleaners for dry cleaning service (since it was next to her favorite Italian restaurant). Therefore, I proposed to get a reasonable price for the damage goods and good discount for services. Final agreement: $120 and 15% discount for services for 2 years. Both of us went home happily and felt good about our relationship.</p>

<p>What we had started with was called positions. I wanted $330 and she insisted on $80. By arguing only on our positions, we would definitely destroy our relationship in no time. To avoid doing so, we focused on interests, not positions. And when our relationship was already quite good, listening to her pouring her heart out was easier than ever. I understood that with the malfunctioning machine, she would have to replace a new machine and compensate other clients just like me. It would be nearly impossible for her to give me the amount I had asked for. However, on my side, I needed to make sure that I would receive a reasonable compensation. Therefore, the final solution we sorted out was that she would pay me a minimal compensation plus the discount on the service. This was one way to break down the compensation to reduce the burden she was facing after the accident.</p>

<p>I cannot emphasize enough how importantly relationship means to negotiation in business transaction. A few months ago, I was looking for a second-hand SONY Walkman MP3 player. After looking around on five.vn (similar to Ebay), I called one guy who listed his MP3 player for sale and arranged an appointment to meet him at his house. When talking to him about his place, I just found out that he was a Christian. I told him I was a Christian too. And a Christian meets another Christian is like a person meets his brother. He and I seemed to know each other for several years despite the fact that we had just met for half an hour. After that, we agreed on the price of the MP3 player without going back and forth too many times and I went home happily with a second-hand MP3 player in a good condition and with a guarantee that whenever I had any problems with it he would be available to bring it to the SONY service to fix as long as the warranty was still valid. That was how relationship got me a nice deal. No matter how big and small the deal is, I believe that relationship works most of the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most difficult case ever! I hope I will never be such a situation in real-life. And I wish the other team read the book (GTY) more carefully. Our team was leaders of A-Far, a very poor region suffering from a lack of infrastructure and very limited health and educational services. We had a meeting with a team of Footsteps employees on starting up and operating a school in the community of northeastern A-Far. There were a few terms that we needed to settle down. Our team’s mistake was how we prioritized the interests. We should have started with the money because in this case the money to ensure A-Far’s survival was much more important than the five conditions regarding the operation of the school. One more lesson we learnt from this exercise was that we should have listed out all five conditions right up front and went through them in order from easiest to most difficult, starting with easiest first.</p>

<p>In our negotiation, we struggled a little bit at the five conditions but still resolved them. I knew that some of our conditions might sound ridiculous to some people but we needed to insist on them because A-Far people must follow strictly the rules of Muslim religion and the country’s culture. In negotiation, if we understand more about the other side’s background, culture, religion and belief which are the parts that cannot be separated from the people, the requirements/conditions will make more sense to us. It is called putting ourselves in the shoes of the negotiators. Lacking of those skills, the other team thought our requirements were so strict that they kept saying out loud in our mother language that we were too arrogant, and we were too poor to ask for too much. It was very unprofessional and insulting. I myself believed that Christians would not likely say something like that. However, even if they would, we knew the right way to response. Although we were very tempted to fight back, we just allowed them to let off steam, avoided reacting to their emotional outbursts (GTY) and did our best to switch back to our discussion based on the objective criteria. Without waiting to be asked, we conveyed our interests lying behind our proposals and also inquired about their interests, so that we could work out the solutions.</p>

<p>Finally, we agreed on the five conditions, but here came the money issue. The other team used what Fisher and Ury (GTY) called “Dirty Tricks”. They threw personal attacks on us. Sometimes, they even reopened the issues that we thought that we had settled down. There were times when we talked about the money they should pay us they didn’t increase their numbers but even decreased it although we reduced the amount we requested. According to GTY, if the other side didn’t change their position – didn’t increase their offer or decrease their demand – then we shouldn’t change our position either. Otherwise we were just arguing with ourselves/negotiating against ourselves. In the end, we worked out another solution and they accepted. I felt that they were not completely happy with it. They just accepted it because we ran out of time. I also felt that this negotiation really made our relationship worse, inside and outside the classroom. Therefore, after that I told them that we didn’t mean to make them feel comfortable, the exercise was too hard and we didn’t have a lot of room to move, hence the inefficient negotiation.</p>

<p>The exercise was difficult indeed, but we learnt so much from it. My teammate told me to think positively about it: if we can handle difficult cases/hard bargainers, we would not be afraid of any other situations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here was the negotiation exercise for this week. Our team, as a group of doctors, must decide three among seven patients would receive the H2N2 vaccine. The other four would die. We prioritized those seven people based on the following criteria: what influence he/she had on the society, well-being of other people, and how importantly his/her life related to others. The difficulty we had this week was not from the other team but actually from our team itself. I was not sure if it was because we didn’t have the same objective criteria in our minds or we were too stubborn to change but one member of our team seemed not to agree with the others on the choices despite how hard I tried to persuade her. Later when I read more on GTY I learned a technique that I wished I had known before. It was called “Negotiation Jujitsu”. What it said was that if the other side announced a firm position, I might be tempted to criticize and reject it. If she criticized my proposal, I might be tempted to defend it and dig myself in. If she attacked me, I might be tempted to defend myself and counterattack. And by doing these things, I would end up playing the positional bargaining game. What “Negotiation Jujitsu” suggested was:</p>

<pre><code>1) Don’t attack her position, look behind it

2) Don’t defend my ideas, invite criticism and advice

3) Recast an attack on me as an attack on the problem

4) Ask questions and pause
</code></pre>

<p>Because I didn’t know the tactics above, what we did in order to finish our discussion was using a classic yet unsatisfactory policy, “majority wins”.</p>

<p>The team with whom we negotiated was very cooperative. They listened to our arguments and vice versa. Though both of two teams didn’t have the same choices of who to be saved, we had great discussions. We had one choice in common. After our team persuaded them to save one more person from our choices, we were stuck a little bit at the last one. However, the negotiation session ended very well after our team decided to save the person they suggested in their choices. It was not because of the fact that they let us save one person from our proposal but the following reason. All of us agreed that the last person we saved was the best one to fulfill the criteria that we established within our discussion, which meant both parties were pleased with the final outcomes without giving in any kind of benefits.</p>

<p>Personally I truly love the idea of separating the people from the problem in negotiation. I myself value long-term relationship and would like to have a win-win in every situation. However, from my observation, there are still a lot of people out there who would like to take advantages of others as long as they get as much as they want. And I think if only they considered the benefits that long-term relationships can bring to them, they would do something different and make it easier for everyone. Last year, I worked as an intern for an Australian company named ABC. The internship was a mandatory part of my program at RMIT Vietnam and was one year long. For the whole year ABC tried to squeezed as much as possible out of interns like me because they just knew that we couldn’t quit and must finish our internship because it was hard to find new companies for interns and we had to present legitimate reasons to quit. As a matter of fact, Vietnam labor laws seem to stand against employees and for employers. What I could do at that moment was to work like a robot hoping every day would go by as fast as possible. There was almost nothing to negotiate in this scenario. Even if there was a chance to negotiate, I had a very weak BATNA: to stop working, let RMIT know about the case, have 3-side (RMIT, ABC, and me) discussion about the problems I was having and start the internship all over again with a new company, if any. Fortunately, those horrible days ended and now I am having another job in a good company. They understand that I need to go to classes in working hours and we together work out how I can work and study at the same time. This is a great example of how people can collaborate with each other to solve a problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This semester at RMIT, I take a very interesting course named “Negotiating Transnational Agreement”. Many things in our lives require good negotiation skills. I bet a lot of insights would be gained from this course.</p>

<p>In the 2nd week, I had my first team exercise. We were members of a team of agents representing the Lyric Opera (LO), a local opera house. We would meet a team of agents for a singer named Sally Soprano (SS) who wanted to sing in LO’s next opera. Our team is supposed to negotiate with the other team on the package that we would pay SS in order to hire her for the primary role of the opera. A lot of information surrounding the case is provided. Choosing which info to use is the challenging part of the exercise, since a rule of thumb during a negotiation is “only give up information about us and our position that will enhance our bargaining power”.</p>

<p>Therefore, we as one team prepared for the negotiation by identifying clearly what our Best Alternative To the Negotiated Agreement (BATNA), Reservation Price/Position, and Target/Aspiration Price. If we could not reach the agreement with SS’s agents, our BATNA would be get the secondary role singer to sing as primary role and we just have to pay maximum $28,000. Nevertheless, that would be our last choice and we would do our best to get Sally.</p>

<p>The other team, our counterparts, are really tough negotiators. Based on Thomas-Kilmann Questionnaire, I thought that they approached us with competing/forcing style (sharks). There are five negotiating styles but there is no negotiating style that is perfectly fit for every situation. I wish I knew which style is the best to deal with sharks. At that time, out team just used the method of principled negotiation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1300873936&amp;sr=8-1-spell">Getting to Yes</a> by insisting on fairness. We discussed about why their offer was reasonable. With their first offer $50,000, I knew that I could make it in under $45,000. However, I didn’t want to accept the offer so fast. Therefore, we tried to press the price down. In the middle of the negotiation, I felt we were falling in positional bargaining. I got out of that situation by investigating more of our interests and theirs. Our group wanted to ensure good ticket sales and opera’s reputation, and their interest was good salary and reputation as well. Therefore, I made them involve more on the opera’s revenue by dividing the salary into 2 parts: fixed salary and bonus (if sales target is met).</p>

<p>What we could have done better is to be the one who offer the price first because that would set the price range. Besides, we should have requested for a confidentiality agreement that the other party keep the salary a secret since this was an urgent case so that in future salary negotiating, we wouldn’t overpay the singer.</p>

<p>One of the skills that I always use in real-life cases whether it is to resolve a dispute and engage in a negotiation with someone is listening skill. It works perfectly because by listening carefully, I let them know that I am really interested in collaborating with them to find the solution for the problem. Our same opponent is the problem itself and our mission is to work together to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Personally, I can’t think of any complaints about this course. It has been more than what I had expected before the semester began. The idea of principled negotiation is so innovative, and I believe that it can be applied in every situation.</p>

<p>Bruce Lee once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p></blockquote>

<p>I guess what I should do now is to start using this method in every negotiation I have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this book Sonja Lyubomirsky provides a scientific approach to pursue happiness. Nice research. This book lifted me up when I fell down. Though there are things that lie outside of my Circle of Influence and it’s true that there is such a gene called “happiness gene”, it is so delightful to know that I can make shots to make me happier, even though I don’t inherit that gene from my parents.</p>

<h1>My Notes</h1>

<blockquote><p>It’s never too late to be what you might have been. - George Elliot</p></blockquote>

<h2>1. The 40% Solution</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="https://img.skitch.com/20121009-nkendgrm99pkd786xuri5itj1f.jpg" title="What determines happiness" ></p>

<p>Becoming lastingly happier demands making some permanent changes that require effort and commitment everyday of your life. Pursuing happiness takes work, but consider that this “happiness work” may be the most rewarding work you’ll ever do.</p>

<p>Subjective Happiness Scale, Depression Scale, Personal-Activity Fit Diagnostic (refer the book)</p>

<p><strong>Myth 1: Happiness must be found.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Myth 2: Happiness lies in changing our circumstances.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Myth 3: You either have it or you don’t.</strong></p>

<h3>The limits of life circumstances:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>material wealth: Frank Lloyd Wright observed: “Many wealthy people are little more than the janitors of their possessions.” Not only does materialism not bring happiness, but it’s been shown to be a strong predictor of unhappiness.</p></li>
<li><p>beauty.</p></li>
<li><p>The only exception that I would argue is the effects of having children. As a mother of two I can attest that the first time you cuddle with your child, it feels wonderful. The thousandth time, it feels – oh, maybe 95 percent as wonderful.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you’re unhappy with your job, your friends, your marriage, your salary, or your looks, the first step you should take toward reaching greater lasting happiness is to put those things aside in your mind for now. Hard as it is, try not to reflect on them. Keep reminding yourself that these things are really not what is preventing you from getting happier.</p>

<p>If we observe genuinely happy people, we shall find that they do not just sit around being contented. They make things happen. They pursue new understandings, seek new achievements, and control their thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Happiness consists in activity. It is a running stream, not a stagnant pool.</p>

<h3>Five hows behind sustainable happiness:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Positive Emotion: Happiness consists more in small conveniences or pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of good fortune that happen but seldom. – Benjamin Franklin</p></li>
<li><p>Optimal Timing &amp; Variety: How to accomplish this? Through experimentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Support.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation, Effort, and Commitment</p></li>
<li><p>Habit</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>First, I will try the Happiness Activity 3: Avoiding Overthinking and Social Comparison</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Overthinking is thinking too much, needlessly, passively, endlessly, and excessivly pondering the meanings, causes, and consequences of your character, your feelings, and your problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of us believe that when we feel down, we should try to focus inwardly and evaluate our feelings and our situation in order to attain self-insight and find solutions that might ultimately resolve our problems and relieve unhappiness. In fact, studies show that overthinking ushers in a host of adverse consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>You must imitate the behaviour of the happy person and work to break free of overthinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Social Comparison: The happiness people take pleasure in other people’s success and show concern in the face of others’ failure.  Unhappy people are deflated rather than delighted about his peers’ accomplishments and triumphs and are relieved rather than sympathetic in the face of his peers’ failures and undoings.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>2. How to Shake of Ruminations and Social Comparisons</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Cut loose:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stop thinking about it. Distract, distract, distract. The distracting activity is what can make you feel happy, curious, peaceful, amused, proud.</p></li>
<li><p>Shout to yourself “STOP!”, “NO!”. Visualize a STOP sign.</p></li>
<li><p>Set aside time for ruminations (deep reflections) later.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to a sympathetic and trusted person.</p></li>
<li><p>Write out your ruminations.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Act to solve problems: find possible solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dodge overthinking triggers: avoid future overthinking traps (places, times, and people)</p></li>
<li><p>Take in a big picture: Ask yourself “Does it matter in a year?”. If no, stop overthinking. If yes, learn the lessons. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just ironed some shirts and trousers that are enough for me to wear for the next week. I also laid a coat of Kiwi polish on my black shoes and would brush them tomorrow morning. It’s a tip I learned before. Lay the polish coat on the leather shoes and let it lie there for one night before you brush it away. Try it. Trust me, you will be happy.</p>

<p>I am fond of saying a true gentleman doesn’t feel properly dressed unless his shoes are freshly shined every morning. And I love the ritual so much that I can’t help but do it very often. That ritual makes me so happy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://img.skitch.com/20121009-8rn9n5mxdnhqc7ic2f3w4sxmfr.jpg" title="Polish shoes" ></p>

<p>So far, I learned quite a lot about what makes me happy and what doesn’t. Polishing my shoes makes me happy. Ironing my clothes myself, not having someone else do it except my girlfriend, makes me happy. Playing billiards with my close friends makes me happy. Winning certainly makes me happier than losing, but losing still does if it is worth it.</p>

<p>There is one thing which always makes me miserable and usually screw up other things. Something happens to me the way it is not expected, I just spend plenty of time contemplating on turning it to the way it should be. And when things get worse, I feel like a loser. I can’t think of anything else. My girlfriend and I have big fights because of this.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Anh Do, and I am an over-thinker.</p>

<p>Over-thinking is thinking too much, needlessly, passively, endlessly and excessively pondering the meaning, causes, and consequences of your character, your feelings and your problems. Many people (including me) believe that when they feel down, they should focus inwardly and evaluate their feelings and situation in order to find self-insight and solutions that might ultimately resolve the issues and relieve unhappiness. Many studies, however, show that over-thinking ushers in a host of adverse consequences.</p>

<h2>How I will stop it:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Distract, distract, distract. I’ll listen to my favorite Brian Culbertson’s album, go swimming or do whatever I find interesting.</li>
<li>Set aside time to think about it later. If it matters in a year, find a solution. If not, just forget it. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</li>
<li>Talk to a sympathetic and trusted person.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have started doing this for more than 3 weeks and my level of happiness improved. Nevertheless, sometimes I still fell in my own trap. Everything needs practice. For something related to one’s nature, it takes time and patience. I need help from you also. If you, my friends, find me over-thinking, please tap me on the shoulder or if you don’t mind, shout at me and hit me in the head. I will be thankful. You have my word.</p>
