_This is the ad I wrote to sell my car. I got a lot of phone calls to check out the car. It was sold within 10 days. The lucky buyers are two French twin sisters. :)_

If you are looking to own a car to take a girl on a date... you have come to the wrong place.

If however, you don't give a damn about your appearance because you are too cool to care, or you are on a low budget, may I present to you, one of the finest feats in Australian engineering: 1999 Holden Commodore VT Wagon. 

There is just too much of Australia in this car. My uncle and Mickey his blue heeler used to drive this car to a nearby dog park or dog beach every weekend. Mickey was put down last February and it was too hard for my uncle to continue keeping the car without thinking about Mickey, so he passed it to me. This car has been serviced twice and lovingly cared since then.

There are a few scratches at the front and the back. The air conditioning isn't working. Neither is the door lock. You also won't be able to roll the driver seat window all the way up. Hence the cheap price. The engine has still been a dream.

Purchase of this vehicle will result in a dramatic rise in the number of looks of admiration you get at Bunnings warehouses. I would personally recommend wearing rugged boots, loose jeans, half-open shirt and cowboy hat to truly get desired attention. Also remember not to shave your hairy chest. 

No mucking around please. I do really want to sell this car.
