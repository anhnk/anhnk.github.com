It has been almost 2 months since I came to Melbourne. I had never been outside Vietnam before, and my 1st overseas trip was to a place 6705.69 km away from my hometown. That is a big distance. I believe there are plenty of people who never travel that far in their whole life. I should expect to have a lot of new experiences. So far I really do.

Culture is obviously an abstract thing. That is one element of life that cannot be captured. You may hear a lot from others' stories, read travel magazines or watch Travel Channel on cable TV, but you will never know what it really is until you experience it at first hand. One word. Amazing! Yeah, I wish I had had a chance to travel abroad when I was younger.
 
I used to work in American and Australian companies. I went to meetings with people from various countries. In business context, however, human interaction rarely goes beyond certain boundaries. You probably give them firm handshakes, maintain eye contact with them, or even share life stories in dinners after business meetings. Nevertheless, they will never be the same as fist bumps with my cousins' friends or hugs and air-kisses with girls. People express their emotions and feelings much more strongly here. I see a lot of body movements and facial expression. People can laugh and talk out loud on the street without worrying that someone will judge or look at them as if they just return from outer space. In short, to me, life cannot be better here.
 
I came on the Xmas holidays. No firms were hiring. Right after the holidays, fortunately, I got a great job and have been working for a few days. The working environment is exactly what I have imagined. Professional, fast-paced and fun. High five if you also think that most of web development workplaces are like this! I will never regret for quitting my sales and banking job to go back to writing codes. That is the best decision I have made.
 
2 months is not a long time. I still have a whole journey ahead. It has just been started...
