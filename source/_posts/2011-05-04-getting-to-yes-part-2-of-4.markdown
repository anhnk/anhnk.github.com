Here was the negotiation exercise for this week. Our team, as a group of doctors, must decide three among seven patients would receive the H2N2 vaccine. The other four would die. We prioritized those seven people based on the following criteria: what influence he/she had on the society, well-being of other people, and how importantly his/her life related to others. The difficulty we had this week was not from the other team but actually from our team itself. <!--more--> I was not sure if it was because we didn’t have the same objective criteria in our minds or we were too stubborn to change but one member of our team seemed not to agree with the others on the choices despite how hard I tried to persuade her. Later when I read more on GTY I learned a technique that I wished I had known before. It was called “Negotiation Jujitsu”. What it said was that if the other side announced a firm position, I might be tempted to criticize and reject it. If she criticized my proposal, I might be tempted to defend it and dig myself in. If she attacked me, I might be tempted to defend myself and counterattack. And by doing these things, I would end up playing the positional bargaining game. What “Negotiation Jujitsu” suggested was:

    1) Don’t attack her position, look behind it

    2) Don’t defend my ideas, invite criticism and advice

    3) Recast an attack on me as an attack on the problem

    4) Ask questions and pause

Because I didn’t know the tactics above, what we did in order to finish our discussion was using a classic yet unsatisfactory policy, “majority wins”.

The team with whom we negotiated was very cooperative. They listened to our arguments and vice versa. Though both of two teams didn’t have the same choices of who to be saved, we had great discussions. We had one choice in common. After our team persuaded them to save one more person from our choices, we were stuck a little bit at the last one. However, the negotiation session ended very well after our team decided to save the person they suggested in their choices. It was not because of the fact that they let us save one person from our proposal but the following reason. All of us agreed that the last person we saved was the best one to fulfill the criteria that we established within our discussion, which meant both parties were pleased with the final outcomes without giving in any kind of benefits.

Personally I truly love the idea of separating the people from the problem in negotiation. I myself value long-term relationship and would like to have a win-win in every situation. However, from my observation, there are still a lot of people out there who would like to take advantages of others as long as they get as much as they want. And I think if only they considered the benefits that long-term relationships can bring to them, they would do something different and make it easier for everyone. Last year, I worked as an intern for an Australian company named ABC. The internship was a mandatory part of my program at RMIT Vietnam and was one year long. For the whole year ABC tried to squeezed as much as possible out of interns like me because they just knew that we couldn’t quit and must finish our internship because it was hard to find new companies for interns and we had to present legitimate reasons to quit. As a matter of fact, Vietnam labor laws seem to stand against employees and for employers. What I could do at that moment was to work like a robot hoping every day would go by as fast as possible. There was almost nothing to negotiate in this scenario. Even if there was a chance to negotiate, I had a very weak BATNA: to stop working, let RMIT know about the case, have 3-side (RMIT, ABC, and me) discussion about the problems I was having and start the internship all over again with a new company, if any. Fortunately, those horrible days ended and now I am having another job in a good company. They understand that I need to go to classes in working hours and we together work out how I can work and study at the same time. This is a great example of how people can collaborate with each other to solve a problem.
