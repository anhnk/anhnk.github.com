The easiest case ever! Here is the background of the case. My client, Ms. Taylor brought her custom-tailored clothes to Elegance Cleaners for dry cleaning. Unfortunately, their machine destroyed the clothes. Ms. Taylor asked for a compensation of $330 and the counter offer was $80.

My counterpart and I represented as Ms. Taylor and Elegance Cleaners’ lawyers respectively. Two of us knew about each other before. In fact, we had good impression with each other before. I bet this fact helped a lot in the negotiation. Without asking so many questions, we totally understood our interests and reached a successful agreement shortly. Why was it a successful agreement? According to GTY, a negotiation is successful when:

    1) It leads to wise agreement.
    2) It is efficient. In other words, it doesn’t take so much time or effort.
    3) It enhances a strong relationship.

In this case, I did not focus too much on the money. There were way more things I could get besides the compensation money. I’d rather talk about our relationship, and how Ms. Taylor loved to go to Elegance Cleaners for dry cleaning service (since it was next to her favorite Italian restaurant). Therefore, I proposed to get a reasonable price for the damage goods and good discount for services. Final agreement: $120 and 15% discount for services for 2 years. Both of us went home happily and felt good about our relationship.

What we had started with was called positions. I wanted $330 and she insisted on $80. By arguing only on our positions, we would definitely destroy our relationship in no time. To avoid doing so, we focused on interests, not positions. And when our relationship was already quite good, listening to her pouring her heart out was easier than ever. I understood that with the malfunctioning machine, she would have to replace a new machine and compensate other clients just like me. It would be nearly impossible for her to give me the amount I had asked for. However, on my side, I needed to make sure that I would receive a reasonable compensation. Therefore, the final solution we sorted out was that she would pay me a minimal compensation plus the discount on the service. This was one way to break down the compensation to reduce the burden she was facing after the accident.

I cannot emphasize enough how importantly relationship means to negotiation in business transaction. A few months ago, I was looking for a second-hand SONY Walkman MP3 player. After looking around on five.vn (similar to Ebay), I called one guy who listed his MP3 player for sale and arranged an appointment to meet him at his house. When talking to him about his place, I just found out that he was a Christian. I told him I was a Christian too. And a Christian meets another Christian is like a person meets his brother. He and I seemed to know each other for several years despite the fact that we had just met for half an hour. After that, we agreed on the price of the MP3 player without going back and forth too many times and I went home happily with a second-hand MP3 player in a good condition and with a guarantee that whenever I had any problems with it he would be available to bring it to the SONY service to fix as long as the warranty was still valid. That was how relationship got me a nice deal. No matter how big and small the deal is, I believe that relationship works most of the time.
